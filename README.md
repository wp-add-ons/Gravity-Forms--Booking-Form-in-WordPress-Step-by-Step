## What is a WordPress Booking Form?
A WordPress booking form is a form that allows users to book or schedule appointments with you or your business directly from your WordPress website. 

Simple booking forms normally ask for the customer’s name, service, preferred day and time, and the fee. There are many services needed for booking forms. They can be used to reserve a hotel room or a doctor’s appointment, as well as services like nail or hair visits…

Generating a booking form in WordPress can offer several advantages depending on your website’s purpose and functionality. Here are a few reasons why you might want to create a booking form:

* **Online Reservations:** If you run a business that provides services or accepts reservations, such as a hotel, restaurant, salon, or event venue, a booking form allows your customers to make reservations online. This convenience can attract more customers and streamline your booking process.

* **Time and Resource Management:** A booking form helps you manage your time and resources more efficiently. By allowing customers to book appointments or services online, you can minimize phone calls, reduce administrative work, and avoid scheduling conflicts.

* **User Convenience:** Offering a booking form on your WordPress website makes it convenient for users to request appointments or services at any time. They don’t have to wait for business hours or rely on phone calls or emails to make a booking.

* **Integration with Payment Gateways:** If your business requires upfront payments or deposits, a booking form integrated with payment gateways allows customers to make secure payments while booking their appointments or services.

* **Data Collection and Analysis:** Byusing a booking form, you can collect valuable customer data, such as contact information, preferences, and booking history. This data can help you understand your customers better, personalize their experience, and analyze booking patterns to improve your business strategies.

* **Automation and Notifications:** A booking form can automate several processes, such as sending confirmations, reminders, and notifications to both customers and your team. This automation reduces the chances of human error and ensures a smooth booking experience.

Overall, making a booking form in WordPress offers convenience, efficiency, and customization options for businesses that rely on appointments, reservations, or service bookings. It enhances the user

The BookNow admin dashboard is only available to administrators and managers. It contains all of the useful information for you to review, such as **Technical Analysis** –  Approved Appointments, Revenue, Customers, and **Upcoming Appointments.**

It’s significant that you realize that you can **specify the time period** for which you want to examine the data. So you can see how many services were booked, what time of day is busiest, and how much money the firm has earned over time.

## Appointment
Go to the **BookNow** tab and choose **Appointment.**

In the appointments section, you can see all of your current appointments and sort them depending on the **person performing them, the customer, the service type, the staff, or the appointment’s status.**

This part is critical for an administrator or manager because it is where they can change the status of an appointment. So, if you need to **accept, cancel, or reject** any appointments, this is the location to do so.

It is also vital to keep in mind that the appointment allows you to **track employee performance**. You can observe who of your staff is getting the most appointments, attracting repeat customers, and which of the services you offer is the most popular.

## Create Services
To begin, go to the dashboard and select the **BookNow** menu item. Then, choose **Services**.

Services are organized, and a variety of services can be added. Click the **Add New Service** button in the top right corner to begin creating your services.

Now, let’s observe the outcome: When I choose the Nair Cut service, Nami is indicated while Lucas remains unseen. Similarly, when I decide on the Hair Cut service, Nami becomes invisible and Lucas is highlighted.
